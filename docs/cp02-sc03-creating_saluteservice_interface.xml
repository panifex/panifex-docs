		As seen from the picture, fill in the following blanks as such:

		<programlisting>
			Package: org.panifex.salute.spi
			Name: SalutationService
		</programlisting>
		The interface will be later implemented by other bundles.
	</para>

	<para>
		The next thing to do is to insert the content of the
		SalutationService, which is done using the following code:
		<programlisting>
			public interface SalutationService {

			String
			salutationName();

			String salute(String name);
			}
		</programlisting>
	</para>
