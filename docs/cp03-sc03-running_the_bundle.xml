	This console is a simple tool for inspecting and managing OSGI framework instances on the

	To correctly configure these fields, follow these steps: 
	<programlisting>
	Start bundle (to run the bundle)
	Refresh Packages (to refresh the package list)
	Choose file (here we select the afore-compiled jar file)
	</programlisting>
	and click the Install or Update button, which will result with this screen 
	(we can notice that the panifex-samples-salute.spi is neatly installed and active)

	and after clicking on it, the defined context.

	The Salutation combobox is here still empty due to the reason that not 
	a single salutation-service implementation has been defined.
