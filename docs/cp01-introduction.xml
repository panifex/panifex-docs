    <title>Introduction</title>
    
    <para>The key parts on which the Panifex Platform is based on are OSGI and ZK framework.</para>
    
    <para>
        <emphasis>OSGI framework</emphasis> is a module system and service platform for Java 
        programming language which enables a dynamic and wholesome model for components. Its main 
        feature is the <emphasis role="bold">needlessness of rebooting</emphasis> while installing, 
        starting, stopping, updating or uninstalling applications or components which, 
        deployment-wise, come in the form of bundles. The mentioned main feature is possible due to 
        APIs that allow remote downloading of management policies and enable the management of an 
        application development. Bundles are, thus, enabled to detect the addition or removal of 
        services, and to adapt accordingly.
    </para>
    
    <para>
        The latter key part of Panifex, <emphasis>ZK framework</emphasis>, is a Java-written open 
        source Ajax Web application framework designed for easy writing of graphical user interfaces 
        for Web applications. To put it briefly, it is a Java framework for building Web enterprise 
        and mobile applications with little programming knowledge.
